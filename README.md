This game project is a tribute to the pioneering 3D first-person shooter, Wolfenstein 3D. It aims to replicate the core gameplay experience, focusing on the visual rendering achieved through raycasting. The project is built from scratch in C, making use of the MLX (MiniLibX) graphical library, which provides a straightforward way to handle window management, pixel drawing, and image rendering.

The implementation features:

    Raycasting Engine: The heart of the 3D rendering, projecting rays from the player's view to detect wall intersections and distances.

    Textured Walls: Applying distinct textures to different walls to create a more immersive and visually rich environment.

    Player Movement: Basic first-person movement within the 2D map projected into a 3D view.

‚ú® Features

    First-Person Raycasting Engine: Renders a pseudo-3D environment from a 2D map.

    Textured Walls: Support for loading and applying textures to map walls.

    Player Movement: Smooth movement (forward/backward) and rotation (left/right).

    Basic Map Loading: Reads a simple 2D map structure to define the level layout.

    MLX Integration: Leverages MLX for window creation, event handling, and image manipulation.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

    C Language: The primary programming language.

    MLX (MiniLibX): A simple graphical library (often used in 42 school projects) for rendering.

    Raycasting Algorithm: The mathematical technique used for 3D projection.
